# ZeroMRR

![ZeroMRR](/zeromrr-homepage.png)

So I saw what [Marc Lou](https://x.com/marc_louvion) did with [trustmrr.com](https://trustmrr.com) and noticed the concerns people had with giving their Stripe API key away. (Which are not irrational concerns)

After I noticed the post from [Shyjal](https://x.com/shyjal/status/1984495091143020911), I just had to build this.

As you can see, it is fully open-source, self-hosted in the EU and has a privacy policy. Also, no Stripe API key is needed because, well, >= $0 MRR applies universally. 😅

Don't judge the code too harshly, I didn't have that much time. That being said, I welcome contributions!
